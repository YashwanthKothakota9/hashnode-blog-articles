This blog describes briefly about how to setup environment for backend project.

Before you setup the backend environment I assume `node` is already installed on your system. If not [click here](https://nodejs.org/en) and download LTS (*long term support*) version. After that follow the below steps.

### Create `package.json` file

* Initialise a new ***Node.js*** project by creating a `package.json` file with the command `npm init -y`.
    
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1709223107741/f300b1cb-4d75-48e0-8020-d332f366dfc4.png align="center")
    
    Here `-y` flag automates the process, accepting default values for all prompts. Without `-y` flag `npm init` would ask for a series of questions to provide information for `package.json` file. `package.json` file is essential for managing `Node.js` project as it stores project metadata (name, author, version, etc), dependencies and scripts. You can always edit your `package.json` after it is created.
    

### Setup Typescript

* Install your first dependency `typescript`.
    
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev typescript
    ```
    
    After you run this command `typescript` will be installed and listed under `devDependencies` in `package.json` file.
    
    There are two types of dependencies:
    
    \- dependencies: which are needed in both `development` and `production`.
    
    \- devDependencies: which are needed only during `development`.
    
    You can see a `node_modules` folder which contains packages which are installed, so `typescript` will be present inside this folder.
    
* After `typescript` is installed we need a `tsconfig` file which is a typescript configuration file which contains some information on how `typescript` should behave. It is same as like a `conductor` in `orchestra` who directs the performance with the movement of hands and arms, here it acts a `conductor` and directs `typescript` how to behave based on the configuration settings given.

* Run this command
    
    ```bash
    npx tsc --init
    ```
    
    * `npm` installs packages
        
    * `npx` executes packages
        
    * `tsc` is a typescript compiler
        
    
    This command creates `tsconfig.json` file. It contains lot of `options`, most of them are optional so they are commented. There are some `tsconfig bases` which provide set of default configuration settings tailored for specific environment. If you want to dig deep into this, [check this repo](https://github.com/tsconfig/bases). I will write a in-depth blog on `bases` and `tsconfig` options soon.
    
    Tip: ðŸš€ Shortcut for `npm install` is `npm i.`
    
    Sample `tsconfig.json` file:
    
    ```json
    {
        "compilerOptions":{
            "module":"NodeNext",
            "moduleResolution":"node",
            "basUrl":"src",
            "outDir":"dist",
            "sourceMap":true,
            "noImplicitAny":true,
        },
        "include":["src/**/*"] // recursively includes all files folders
                               // inside src folder
                                  
    }
    ```
    
* Now install `express`
    
    ```bash
    npm i express
    ```
    
    In earlier versions we need to explictly install types for express `@types/express`, from the `version:4.17.0` it is not needed as `express` includes its own `typescriptdefinition` files directly within its `package`.
    

### Setup nodemon and ts-node

* Next: We need these two only in development
    
    * Install `nodemon` - This is a package which is used to automatically restart the server whenever we make changes to the code.
        
        ```bash
        npm i --save-dev nodemon
        ```
        
    * Install `ts-node` - This package transpiles the typescript code to javascript code.
        
        ```bash
        npm i --save-dev ts-node
        ```
        
        Tip: ðŸš€ Shortcut for `--save-dev` is `-D`.
        
    * Create a config file for nodemon `nodemon.json` which specifies settings to tailor the nodemon.
        
        Sample `nodemon.json` file:
        
        ```json
        {
            "watch": ["src"],//watch the directory should be same as in
                             //tsconfig.json file
            "ext": ".ts,.js",//extensions
            "exec": "ts-node ./src/server.ts"
        }
        ```
        
    * Now add a command under `scripts` in `package.json`.
        
        ```json
        "scripts":{
            "start":"nodemon"
        }
        ```
        
        Create a new file for example `server.ts` which will be the main entry point for the server and run `npm start` which starts the `server`, make changes to the file the server will automatically adopts to it because of `nodemon` and `ts-node`.
        

### Setup ESLint

* Next: Install `eslint` and create a configuration file for it.
    
    ```bash
    npm i -D eslint
    npx eslint --init
    ```
    
    When you run this command it asks for some series of questions
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1709265228172/8590216f-e0ce-4f53-b8fc-d20f17ee65cb.png align="center")

    Here we select `none of these` because we are using it in backend `node` environment.

    Select `package manager` of your choice
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1709265434331/501bf0b2-15bc-44fa-827f-70ef4353533a.png align="center")
    
    Sample `eslintrc.js` config file
    
    ```json
    module.exports = {
        "env": {
            "es2021": true,
            "node": true
        },
        "extends": [
            "eslint:recommended",
            "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
        ],
        "overrides": [
            {
                "env": {
                    "node": true
                },
                "files": [
                    ".eslintrc.{js,cjs}"
                ],
                "parserOptions": {
                    "sourceType": "script"
                }
            }
        ],
        "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
    }
    ```
    
    Now add `lint` script in `package.json`
    
    ```json
    "scripts":{
        "start": "nodemon",
        "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts",
    }
    ```
    
    Now run `npm run lint` command to run eslint to check for any problems in the code. There is additionally vscode extension [eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) which shows up warnings directly in our code without need to run from command line. But we need to run this from command line before building the project for production to catch any potential problems.
    

### Setup Prettier

* Bonus ðŸŽ‰ : Setup `prettier`
    
    Firstly install it as a devDependency
    
    ```bash
    npm i -D prettier
    ```
    
    Create `.prettierrc` file
    
    ```json
    Example:
    {
      "singleQuote": false,
      "bracketSpacing": true,
      "tabWidth": 2,
      "trailingComma": "es5",
      "semi": true
    }
    ```
    
    Mainly `prettier` used to format code with a given config settings in entire project. In large code bases when several developers are working on same project `formatting` rules are required so that entire code base is `consistent`. Change settings from above example file explore various options to configure. There is also a vscode extension called [prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode), which can also be used for formatting. Check below flow for better understanding of how `prettier` works.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1709267926011/06d77f24-4419-4886-90fb-5fadb5084d96.png align="center")
    
    The command line comes into use when it is needed to format entire codebase at once, in other cases prettier extension is fine.
    
* This is a sample pipeline for production grade typescript applications

    Every tool requires its own config file to specify configuration settings to tailor its behaviour. These are not the only tools available, there are many tools to select from for each step. Explore online for more options. I will write in-depth blog about `production grade build pipelines` soon.

Hope this makes you feel comfortable with the setup for production grade node.js typescript backend project. Google or ask chatGPT the different options present to configure each tool mentioned. Feel free to reach out to me for any questions!  
Happy learning :)
